\pard\pardeftab720\sl360\partightenfactor0
\cf2 The other night dear, as I lay sleeping\
I dreamed I held you in my arms\
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken\
So I hung my head and I cried.\
\
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine\
You make me happy when skies are gray\
You'll never know dear, how much I love you\
Please don't take my sunshine away\
\
I'll always love you and make you happy,\
If you will only say the same.\
But if you leave me and love another,\
You'll regret it all some day:\
\
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine\
You make me happy when skies are gray\
You'll never know dear, how much I love you\
Please don't take my sunshine away\
\
You told me once, dear, you really loved me\
And no one else could come between.\
But not you've left me and love another;\
You have shattered all of my dreams:\
\
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine\
You make me happy when skies are gray\
You'll never know dear, how much I love you\
Please don't take my sunshine away\
\
In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me\
When I awake my poor heart pains.\
So when you come back and make me happy\
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame.\
\
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine\
You make me happy when skies are gray\
You'll never know dear, how much I love you\
Please don't take my sunshine away\
